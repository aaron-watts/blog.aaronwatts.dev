            <p>2026 has been slow getting started for me. I was just about done with Christmas and New Year celebrations, ready to get back to life's usual flow, but then I got a damned flu.</p>

<p>I had been trying to avoid it. I work in a youth club with kids visiting from numerous local schools, and also commute to work via the busy London train network. So I am surprised I didn't get it sooner - given the state of my fellow commuters throughout December, I was sure it was going to spoil the festive period for me. But I was lucky. For a time.</p>
<p>I had been looking forward to continuing work on some of my projects, and starting some new ones. But I was floored for about a week. When I felt myself beginning to recover, I did make a start on one of my planned projects, if only to feel like I had at least <em>one</em> productive evening that week. I made I good start, and now it's back on the shelf while I wait for some things to come in the post.</p>
<p>The last 4 days I have been busy back at work - a week with flu had me more than eager to get out of the house again and doing something useful. I even gave up my usual work from home day this week in the revelry of being able to comfortably leave the house again.</p>
<p>I do tend to suffer some inertia going in to and coming out of breaks. I've been somewhat scratching my head and avoiding my desk for want of knowing what to start first. This blog has been helpful getting me to my keyboard. It's a low effort exercise that I can do to get things started. The CMS software handles everything for me, so I can just type out some <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dribble</span>/thoughts and feel like I've accomplished something.</p>

                              <p>This is the second year that I've opted to stay away from my computer (in a recreational sense) throughout the lead up to Christmas. I feel better for it. As much as I enjoy working on my various projects, December can always feel like there isn't enough time to get everything done, especially around work and catching up with friends and family.</p>
