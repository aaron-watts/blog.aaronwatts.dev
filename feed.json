            "content_html": "<p>I've managed to find some time to spend at my computer recently, after all the festivities and flu. I decided I would continue working on the accessibility and ARIA compliance on my main website. Next on the list was the filter search that I use on my index pages.</p>\n\n<p>Each article has a list of tags (which I call topics on my site), and some JavaScript code makes a list of clickable topics near the start of the page that will filter the articles that contain the selected topic.</p>\n<p>The first thing I decided to do was to place the all the filter search related elements into a search element. I hadn't known this element existed until I researched ARIA. So now it's all in a semantically named landmark for assistive technologies to distinguish. Great!</p>\n<p>In the dev tools in Firefox, I was getting a warning in the accessibility pane that these things that behave as buttons do not have the role of buttons. Originally it was because I had the CSS made up for my topic tags, so I just made the same topic tags to sit at the top of the page - the only difference being that these ones are clickable. Well, if something behaves like a button, why not just make it a button? I've styled my buttons in my website to look like anchors, but with descriptive text that makes it quite obvious that this thing I click does something on the page instead of taking me to a different page - it's fine, it's visually noticeable and the intent is explicitly indicated. So I had to do some CSS trickery to make these buttons look like topic tags instead. Everything looks the same as before, except now the topic buttons are now focusable, and there's a sensibly named landmark.</p>\n<p>One more thing about buttons: as these are stateful buttons, I also needed to include the <code>aria-pressed</code> attribute.</p>\n<p>Previously (or currently, depending on when you're reading this; I still have to make some updates to the CMS Python module to reflect these changes), I have truncated the topics list using <code>max-height</code> and a fade with <code>overflow: hidden</code>. I set a resize listener on the window to pick up on when a browser window might be tiled to the side - I was truncating the list if it exceeded X amount of the vertical screen real estate. When I gave it some thought, I realised there were 2 issues with this. The first is that although they are hidden from view, all the topics were still in the accessibility tree, so for my guides index page, a user would have to sit through 37 topics before getting to the article links. That's too many. The second was my realisation that this is what was responsible for a graphical glitch on only <em>some</em> mobile browsers - particularly the browsers that hide the address bar on scroll, and you know, resize the window? Duh. How did it take until now to realise why that was happening? (face-palm).</p>\n<p>So threw away my JavaScript truncation, and replaced it with a fairly tidy piece of CSS:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code>search#topics {\n  ...\n\n  &amp;.truncated li:nth-of-type(n+7) {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Now, when the <code>truncated</code> class is applied to the <code>ul</code> element, only the first 6 topics are rendered. Thanks to <code>display: none;</code>, this is the case for the visual document <em>and</em> the accessibility tree.</p>\n<p>Next I needed some user messages, with <code>aria-describedby</code>, <code>aria-live=\"polite\"</code>, and <code>role=\"status\"</code> to indicate the various states of the topic list. There are two different <em>\"statenesses\"</em> here, if you will pardon my English.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If a filter is currently applied or not</li>\n<li>If the list of topics is truncated or not</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm not sure that two status indicators can describe the same UI component, and I didn't want to potentially create confusion even if they could. So I bundled both messages into the same <code>p</code> element, with a <code>span</code> for each and an <code>id</code> to distinguish between each. With the user feedback messages, all the lines I had stripped from my JavaScript file were quickly refilled with new code. But for a better experience for an end user: it's arguably worth it.</p>\n<p>Any structural work to my website, such as this, requires some modification and testing with the CMS module. But after that's done and changes are pushed, I shouldn't have to think about it again. There is one aspect I'm mulling over before I finalise my changes: when all filters are showing, i.e. no truncation, and a topic is selected to apply a filter that is placed <em>after</em> where the truncation would occur (so index 7 onwards), if the topic list is then truncated, then that topic is hidden and can't be deselected without reopening the full list. It's a dead end situation that can be escaped, but requires more analysis and problem solving than what is fair to place onto an end user. As I assess, I think I may be able to just apply <code>display: inline;</code> to the selected topic to override the <code>display: none;</code> that is applied to truncate it, ensuring any selected topic is not hidden from view, regardless of it's index.</p>\n<p>When looking up potential methods for applying a search filter, I came across a few different options that I didn't really vibe with for this use case. But I must admit I was especially pleased that W3 schools offered the <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_filter_elements.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same solution</a> as I has already came up with myself. It's nice to have some affirmation that you are making good decisions.</p>",

I was just about done with Christmas and New Year celebrations, ready to get back to life's usual flow, but then I got a damned flu.</p>\n\n<p>I had been trying to avoid it. I work in a youth club with kids visiting from numerous local schools, and also commute to work via the busy London train network. So I am surprised I didn't get it sooner - given the state of my fellow commuters throughout December, I was sure it was going to spoil the festive period for me. But I was lucky. For a time.</p>\n<p>I had been looking forward to continuing work on some of my projects, and starting some new ones. But I was floored for about a week. When I felt myself beginning to recover, I did make a start on one of my planned projects, if only to feel like I had at least <em>one</em> productive evening that week. I made I good start, and now it's back on the shelf while I wait for some things to come in the post.</p>\n<p>The last 4 days I have been busy back at work - a week with flu had me more than eager to get out of the house again and doing something useful. I even gave up my usual work from home day this week in the revelry of being able to comfortably leave the house again.</p>\n<p>I do tend to suffer some inertia going in to and coming out of breaks. I've been somewhat scratching my head and avoiding my desk for want of knowing what to start first. This blog has been helpful getting me to my keyboard. It's a low effort exercise that I can do to get things started. The CMS software handles everything for me, so I can just type out some <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">dribble</span>/thoughts and feel like I've accomplished something.</p>",

I don't remember if it was a conscious decision or not, but what I do remember was that it might have been the first Christmas I genuinely enjoyed.</p>\n<p>This time around, I knowingly employed the same strategy. I still felt a little stressed as Christmas approached, and like time was running thin, but it didn't stress me out to the point that I had a bad time. Being stressed because you <em>might not</em> have enough time to get everything done, and being stressed because you <em>don't</em> have enough time to get everything done, are two very different beasts.</p>\n<p>Today is the first day in a while that I've been able to ignore my phone, put the radio on, and just sit at my desk for an extended period of time without having to worry about anything else. I booked the past week off work, with the hope that might find a few hours to sit where I am now sooner, but this time of year is busy, and I'm not too upset that I've only got the chance to do this today. I'm back to work tomorrow, and I can back to my usual routine of stealing an hour or two when I can to enjoy myself with some coding or computer based projects.</p>\n<p>Now I just need to look at my projects and figure out where I had got to and what on earth I was about to do before my hiatus..</p>",

The plugin is not the problem here.</p>\n<p>Publii uses Atom feed specification as opposed to RSS. Why? I don't know, it doesn't really matter. RSS and Atom are just two arcane leaves on the same tree that everybody uses without even knowing the technologies exist. They have both been around long enough that any feed reader should be able to parse the data from any given feed .. <em>should.</em></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/nextcloud_news-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"966\" height=\"685\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/nextcloud_news-2-xs.jpeg 640w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/nextcloud_news-2-sm.jpeg 768w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/nextcloud_news-2-md.jpeg 1024w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/nextcloud_news-2-lg.jpeg 1366w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/nextcloud_news-2-xl.jpeg 1600w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/nextcloud_news-2-2xl.jpeg 1920w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Nextcloud News has not differentiated between escaped and non escaped HTML and has render my code blocks into the DOM</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>My favourite feed reader, Nextcloud News, apparently doesn't like Atom HTML content. It may be that Publii has used HTML as the type attribute for the content element. That's the only thing I can think of that could be causing it. Atom's spec says HTML should be escaped, which would the render the escaped HTML in the prism code blocks moot. Maybe this should have been rendered as XHTML? <em>But, then again:</em> this problem doesn't seem to occur in other feed readers I've looked at.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/feedbro.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"927\" height=\"867\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/feedbro-xs.jpeg 640w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/feedbro-sm.jpeg 768w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/feedbro-md.jpeg 1024w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/feedbro-lg.jpeg 1366w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/feedbro-xl.jpeg 1600w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/feedbro-2xl.jpeg 1920w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Feedbro Firefox extension has rendered the content as expected</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I could test my theory, and figure out some kind of a solution. Maybe I could set up a CI/CD solution to tweak the feed after it's made - there is no real way to change the RSS feed at this level within the Publii software. But then again, I think I just won't. The point of blogging in Publii was that it was supposed to be quick and easy. I have enough distractions and rabbit holes already, I don't need another.</p>\n<p>\"Works in most feed readers\" is not bad to be fair. With so many revisions to specifications and differing standards for syndication feeds, I think it's surprising how good the compatibility in general already is, even if it's not perfect in some places. And including full content of an article is technically a complimentary extra to RSS feeds as it is. As for Publii's choice in syndication formats, I will respect it. I will likely just put a warning to let readers know this feed might not work in some readers whenever I include code blocks that resemble XML.</p>\n<p>I will say though: I feel a certain validation in the choices I made with the RSS feed in my main website. In the corners of the syndication software world I have explored as yet, my feed seems to have a pretty high compatibility rate.</p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I've been looking for an excuse to move my main pi 5 over to the TV with the new version of Plasma Bigscreen running on it, and hopefully Steam too. So now my main workhorse is the pi 500+.</p>\n\n<p>It's nice. A mechanical keyboard with changeable back light settings, 16GB RAM and an SSD. It's an upgrade from my pi 5 with 8GB RAM in an Argon One case. That device will be replacing my pi 4 in it's own Argon One case that I have connected to the TV and do all my streaming on. The main reason I've been wanting to get my pi 5 to the TV is how well it handles video, the pi 4 does a good enough job with work arounds for Youtube (Freetube or VaccuumTube, whichever is working at the time), but the pi 5 should be able to jump up my streaming from 720 to 1080.</p>\n<p>I will be putting Raspberry Pi's Debian Trixie OS on there, so it will have the newer Plasma. But that also means that Plasma Bigscreen is not available in the apt repo anymore, so I will have to build it with the KDE developer tools, which I've never used before - hopefully that all goes well. I will put it on my <a href=\"https://aaronwatts.dev/guides/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Guides Page</a> if it works out.</p>\n<p>Back to the 500+. It's my main workhorse now. I've been computing exclusively on Raspberry Pi's for a while now since my installation of Endeavour OS with i3wm decided it didn't like my (admittedly ancient) graphics card. My 2012 MacBook's keyboard had just died, and while I enjoy tinkering and fixing things, I had to clock in to my remote working shift so I just logged in on my pi 4 and was not put off enough by the experience to change my set up thereafter. Shortly after that, the pi 5 released, and for what I'm doing on a computer, the pi 5 was easily powerful enough to do everything I wanted it to do.</p>\n<p>The pi 500+ is just a turbo charged version of what I was already using. I'm working right now with Firefox and Chromium open, while editing on Publii, and the CPU usage is barely hitting 4%, while the GPU bounces between 5% and 10%. I'm becoming a bit of a reluctant pro at setting up Raspberry Pi's Debian. Setting up a Nextcloud and backing up my configs really paid off here. I'm not quite at the stage of having my own setup or install scripts, but if I have to do this many more times I may have to consider it. I'm trying to put my distro hopping days are behind me.</p>\n<p>It is nice to have the entire computer inside the keyboard, it's a nice homage to the old days of computing, and when the tech is becoming this compact - why wouldn't you? Although this does bring additional wires across your desk. I may tie those together to tidy the up a bit. The board is nice and heavy and does not slide around at all while you work. The mechanical keys take a little getting used to if you're used to low keys like I am, but a couple hours of working has me feeling pretty comfortable with the differences already.</p>",

Like right now, from my work (I'm on a break, boss!).</p>\n\n<p>It wasn't hard to set up, the only additional step beside setting the save location was generating an additional token on Github for my site to sync. The token credentials is the only thing that doesn't seem to have copied over - a wise security choice. I'm using Nextcloud, but I don't see why any cloud with a decent sync pattern wouldn't work. So, while Publii doesn't <em>officially</em> support multiple users working on one site, I don't see why you couldn't potentially share the file directory on a cloud with a reasonable caching system.</p>\n<p>However, Publii uses local SQLite to control some data, so this could potentially cause issues across multiple users if they are working on the website at the same time. I'm not entirely sure how something like Redis might manage that, but in my mind's eye, I don't really see it working out too well - especially after having to work through some conflicts in my Nextcloud due to a failed sync operation.</p>\n<p>I think the best approach to cooperative content management would be to appoint an administrator to post content produced by a team to prevent conflicts. But for a sole blogger, like myself, Publii in the cloud is a fantastic way to work.</p>",

I prefer to start using a tool and learn it as I go. I also tend to hyper focus on what I'm doing, so it's easy to miss additional menu's in the top right corner when you've just come to know there's a menu down the left side of the window. Don't get me wrong, it's an intelligent UX choice to keep app breaking settings well away from the regularly used settings, it's a safeguard against inattentive users (stop pointing at me) from accidentally deleting all their work.</p>\n<p>So, I've switched the image engine to Jimp. Unfortunately, you lose the ability to convert to webp format. I like doing things the hard way, so I'm perfectly happy to go through old articles and strip images or purge some git history if it's needed at any point. I'm not expecting to have to even think about that for a while though.</p>\n<p>I also found one other very handy feature in the app settings, which is the default directory where Publii keeps the sites you make with it. This means I could keep the directory in my Nextcloud and work on my blog at my desk or on the go. I haven't had a proper look at how heavy the site directories are yet, and I try to keep my cloud light and more importantly, cheap. So we will see if I still want to do that in the near future.</p>",

I will be modifying the CMS module to match the new layouts, although this shouldn't require too much more work than just jigging the configs to match the new query selectors. I also want to populate OpenGraph and Schema data for articles from within the CMS, but again this should be a relatively simple job as it's just reusing values that already exist within the markup.</p>",
