Well, technically I already have <a href="https://aaronwatts.dev/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several blogs</a>. But those have opinionated topic themes to them, and as such there is nowhere I can go to scream into the wind about the things I care about (what is this <em>social media</em> you speak of?). But there is also another reason for this new blogspace..</p><p>After fine tuning a homebaked CMS (Content Management System) for my website in Python to perform exactly how it wanted it to, I thought I should take a look at existing static website CMS's to see if there is anything I hadn't considered (I know, wrong order of events, but I'm a clumsy hobbyist, and this is just how I <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work</span> play). In my search for static CMS's, I happened upon a software called <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publii</a>, which piqued my curiosity.</p><p>I consider myself a specialist in, or at the very least a staunch advocate of, what I call Low-To-No-Cost solutions. In building my <a href="https://aaronwatts.dev">main website</a> I took note of how much graft it took to get my website to require the minimum amount of work, and how very specific it's use case became as a result of that process. As a thought experiment I pondered of how an equally cheap solution could be offered to those less tech literate than myself. And it looks as though Publii could be the answer to that question.</p><p>I will be using Publii for a little while, to learn a bit more about it before I begin suggesting it to others as a solution. And maybe I'll keep using it thereafter if I grow fond of it? It's looking like there may be a few hurdles for me to surpass, the first of which is that I do all my computing on a Raspberry Pi, and there isn't currently a version in release for Arm64 Linux. This was solved by using an <a href="https://github.com/casimiroarruda/Publii-arm64-releases/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arm64 community build by casimiroarruda</a>, which unfortunately is a few versions behind and doesn't include the <em>pages</em> feature that allows user's to expand their blog sites into static websites proper. But for this use case, that's not really a feature I need, and I have a friend exploring the software on his Macbook too as a potential exit for him out of the Wix ecosystem. Nonetheless, and despite it not necessarily being my forte, I had a stab at compiling the Electron app from source in node, and packaging into deb, rpm and appimage formats on my own machine - but it soon became evident to why the Arm64 build is not on the current version, as it just doesn't work on Arm.</p><p>So, here begins my new blogging adventure..</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on October 18, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Hello%2C%20World! https%3A%2F%2Fblog.aaronwatts.dev%2Fhello-world%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/authors/aaronwattsdev/" rel="author">AaronWattsDev</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/initial-set-up-and-deployment/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Initial Set Up and Deployment</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
