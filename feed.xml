                <p>As soon as I heard that there was a laptop shell being developed for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5, I went to the Kickstarter page and made my pledge. I've seen a few rug pulls on Kickstarter, but I've been using Argon's cases for my Raspberry Pi's and I trust their work and them as company, so I had no concerns there.</p>

<p>I managed to get a full unit with CM5 and SSD already installed so I didn't have to install any scripts or modify the boot config myself. I was most looking forward to being able to do ARM Linux computing on the go, and in that respect, this device certainly delivers.</p>
<p>I've been computing at home on a Pi 500+ recently, and have become quite at home in the defaut Raspberry Pi OS. The Trixie update gave us a much more modern look to the UI which I really like, and in my opinion it can now compete with a well riced XFCE or LX desktop. The Trixie repositories are pretty good, and I find myself installing most things from Apt without having added any additional sources. Even NodeJS seems to be at a point where there is little need to add a more up to date source - I'm not using it for anything cutting edge, and any third party software I use it for seems to run fine so far.</p>
<p>The build quality is good. There's a little rattle in the track pad which made me think it was clickable at first, but I quickly realised it's not. And light taps don't trigger any rattle. The keyboard is nice, I love a super key with the Raspberry Pi logo on it! I'm in the UK but I opt for a US keyboard nowadays. There is a slight bounce issue with the keys where a character can sometimes be typed twice, but it's no worse than the standard Raspberry Pi 500 I had been taking into work with me - and I taught myself touch typing so I see those errors as they happen. The screen is great, with a ratio off 4:3 it is tall and I'm not getting any glare. There's a webcam and microphone built in, and these work in the web browser so I don't need to install Teams from Pi-Apps, I can just use it in the Chromium browser. I made a webcam with a Pi Zero and a camera module for my desktop Teams calls, and that won't work in browsers anymore, I'm not sure what's causing the issue. The camera and mic are fair, better than you'd get with a budget laptop - more than good enough for my use case (Teams meetings for work).</p>
<p>The power key puts the shutdown menu on screen which is a nice touch. There's a hidden backlight feature for the keyboard - at first I thought the kickstarter units didn't have it and it would feature on units made thereafter, but it's here, I saw a comment in the support subreddit that said <em>Fn</em> + <em>Space</em> turns it on. I normally work in well lit areas, but it will be handy when I want to rsync games into RetroPie at night while sitting on my sofa. They didn't solve the battery plugin issue for the system tray, the laptop came with the desktop icon and a button on the keyboard that triggers a notification with the remaining battery percentage. That was good enough, but almost immediately Jeff Curless had posted a <a href="https://github.com/JeffCurless/argon-oneup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solution</a> in the subreddit and hey presto, battery in the system tray! With a working battery plugin in the system tray, there was little need for the self-updating desktop icon/indicator - I like a clean desktop anyhow and normally delete anything that finds it's way there. I deleted the battery icon from the deskop, but the laptops service runner puts it back there. I didn't want to risk breaking anything, so I made a folder in the Desktop folder and called it <em>hidden</em>, and then I just changed my default desktop folder to the <em>hidden</em> folder in the settings menu. Clean desktop!</p>
<p>As it's a laptop, privacy should be considered. Raspberry Pi OS now has a lock screen, but without any tinkering it's in the Shutdown menu by default. And before it was introduced I had already set up my own swaylock script and put <em>Lock Screen</em> option in the menu so I could just hit <em>Super</em> and type <em>Lock</em> for a pixelated Swaylock lock screen with the Pi logo inside the input ring (my time playing with i3wm being put to good use).</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code>#!/bin/bash
icon="$HOME/.Custom/swaylock-pixelate/pi-logo.png"

# create a temp file
img=$(mktemp /tmp/XXXXXXXXXX.png)

# Take a screenshot of current desktop
grim $img

# Pixelate the screenshot
convert $img -scale 10% -scale 1000% $img

# Add the lock image
convert $img $icon -gravity center -composite $img

# Run swaylock with custom background
swaylock --indicator-radius 100 --inside-color 99000000 --inside-clear-color 99000000 --image $img

# Remove the tmp file
rm $img</code></pre>
<p>I keep my zsh, vim and tmux configs in the cloud now so they were nice and quick to set up; I just copied them to the required locations and used the plugin installers. I also keep my labwc rc.xml file in the cloud so I could just copy that over and add the following after the keyboard element for natural scrolling with the trackpad.</p>
<!-- Note: Some feed readers might get confused by XML or HTML, please view in website if something doesn't look right below -->
<pre class="language-html"><code>&lt;libinput&gt;
  &lt;device category="default"&gt;
    &lt;naturalScroll&gt;yes&lt;/naturalScroll&gt;
  &lt;/device&gt;
&lt;/libinput&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I remain an advocate for ARM based Linux computing, and this is the laptop I've been waiting for. Although I wasn't expecting it wouldn't come in the form of a Compute Module shell. That said, I'm very pleased that it did happen this way. In a world of rising energy costs, AI chip hoarding, and fluctuating markets; sustainable methods of computing could be more important than ever before. Massive props from me for <a href="https://argon40.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Argon40</a>, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raspberry Pi</a>, and all the other companies and organisations pushing this niche corner of computing ever farther into the future.</p>

                    <p>I worked out a simple solution to truncate my list of topics using only CSS. It's the only part of my website that really relies on JavaScript. It's wouldn't really be a heavy load for a script to run, but I didn't want to iterate over elements and individually hide them by applying a class to elements one at a time. It seemed like an unnecessary amount of computation, and I thought there was a lighter way to do it.</p>

                <p>I worked out a simple solution to truncate my list of topics using only CSS. It's the only part of my website that really relies on JavaScript. It's wouldn't really be a heavy load for a script to run, but I didn't want to iterate over elements and individually hide them by applying a class to elements one at a time. It seemed like an unnecessary amount of computation, and I thought there was a lighter way to do it.</p>

<p>I was right, there was. But there were issues due to design choices I had already made. Being a hobbyist, I enjoy the liberty of doing what I want when it comes to these things. Even if what I want to do might be a little stupid.</p>
<p>I don't seek out cutting edge technologies when I code my website, but I do use modern solutions where they are well supported. I won't ensure support for old versions of browsers. If it runs on my installation of Debian stable, but it doesn't work on your browser, then you might need to consider updating whatever software you are running.</p>
<p>Another rule I follow for my own website is no layers of obfuscation. That is vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript all the way. There's a few reasons why.</p>
<ol>
<li>It's more fun. I can solve problems myself and learn a whole heap in the process.</li>
<li>I'm not making anything large or complex enough to warrant React or SASS.</li>
<li>Dependencies? Node thank you!</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what have I learned about the state of the internet today? Well, it's doing pretty well. HTML does way more than I originally knew about. That was already the case, but scripted solutions are so commonplace that raw HTML concepts and good practises are often glossed over, if even mentioned at all. CSS can do a lot of the stuff now that people turn to preprocessors for out of the gate. And vanilla JavaScript can hold it's own against JQuery now in any use case that I have encountered. It's the bell curve in action.</p>
<p>So my task was to truncate an unordered list, at say, the 6th or so list element - out of mercy for users of accessible technology. I was already visually cropping the unordered list, but every list element remained in the accessibility tree, meaning someone who is keyboard bound would have to hit tab 37 times to get past my filter list. So I just used an <code>nth-of-type</code> CSS rule when a parent had a class applied to indicate truncation. Later I added a rule to override the previous one for the selected filter if it exceeded the truncation index defined by n.</p>
<pre class="language-css"><code>search#topics {
  &amp; ul {
    &amp;.truncated li {
      &amp;:nth-of-type(n+7) {
        display: none;
      }

      &amp;:has(button[aria-pressed="true"]) {
        display: inline;
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Nice, right? Now, I don't want to be defining the truncation index in CSS and JavaScript separately - having the same thing defined in two places is just asking for a bug to happen when one is changed and the other forgotten. So I don't want this hard-coded in the JavaScript too. Helpfully, any loaded style sheets are available in the document object. Unhelpfully, CSS variables can't be used within selector functions such as <code>nth-of-type</code>. SASS now? No. I'm as stubborn as I am stupid.</p>
<p>The filter search is the only part of my website that currently depends on JavaScript. I've intentionally kept script to a minimum. As the filter search won't work without script, I hide all it's contents by default except for the noscript element using a class called noscript.</p>
<pre class="language-css"><code>search#topics {
  &amp;.noscript &gt; *:not(noscript) {
    display: none;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Then, once the document has loaded, the first execution in the JavaScript unhides it all.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>document.querySelector('search#topics').classList.remove('noscript');</code></pre>
<p>The rest of the script does the following jobs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Makes a <code>set</code> of unique topics based on topics that are associated to articles.</li>
<li>Populate the unordered list with list elements for each topic, each containing a button with an event listener to trigger a filter function.</li>
<li>Check if the number of topics exceeds the topic truncation index, and apply the truncated class to the unordered list if so.</li>
<li>If truncation is required, create a button to toggle truncation on and off.</li>
<li>Update user messages whenever anything changes regarding filters or truncation.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a preference, I like to cache the DOM once, and then pass the required data between functions. I avoid using global variables, and will let the document load before executing any script just to be sure not to encounter any DOM loading issues.</p>
<p>Now, with that in mind, how to get the truncation index used in the CSS selector? Style sheets are included in the document and have a <code>cssRules</code> property each that is defined by it's selector. That's great. But I like to use nesting to make my life easier, and the styleSheets object doesn't distinguish nesting. CSS nesting likely didn't exist when this JavaScript object was first made. Darn. We get access to the base selector <code>search#topics</code>, everything within that is parsed <code>cssText</code>. Okay, that's a hindrance, but like I said I am stubborn.</p>
<p>So what we have now is a <code>getTruncIndex</code> function, that calls a <code>getNumberAfterSubstring</code> function that I borrowed from Stack Overflow because I've been working on this way too long at this point and I can't be bothered to work out the correct regular expression myself.</p>
<p>The next challenge was figuring out if a selected topic fell outside of the truncation limit. If the topic at index 8 is selected, but only the first 6 topics are shown during truncation, then a user is not going to be able to deselect the filter, or even see which topic has is being filtered.</p>
<p>My first idea here was to check if any topic buttons after the truncation index had their <code>display</code> style set to <code>inline</code>, but for some reason, in the document model, all topics had a <code>display</code> attribute of <code>null</code>. I'm not really sure why that is or what's going on there. But fine, I'll find another way.</p>
<p>What I ended up doing was a little more complicated, but I think I'm happy with regardless. <code>TopicList</code> is the unordered list element, we run a query to check if any buttons are currently pressed by checking their aria-pressed attribute. My filter search only filters one topic at a time, so I can be confident of accuracy here. Next, the slice point is defined by checking if there is currently an active filter, and if there is, checking it's index in the original topics array. The slice is then defined based on whether or not the active filter has a greater index the the truncation index.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>function updateTruncMsg(topicList, topics, truncIndex) {
  const truncMsg = document.querySelector('#usr-msg--truncated');
  const activeFilter = topicList.querySelector('button[aria-pressed="true"]');
  const slice = activeFilter &amp;&amp; 
    topics.indexOf(activeFilter.innerText) &gt; truncIndex - 2 ?
    truncIndex : truncIndex - 1;
   
  if (topicList.classList.contains('truncated')) {
    truncMsg.innerText = `Showing ${slice} of ${topics.length} topics`;
  } else {
    truncMsg.innerText = `Showing ${topics.length} of ${topics.length} topics`;
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>So by making things easier for myself, and unknowingly made things harder for myself at the same time. Nonetheless, I won't stop nesting CSS so long as the Epiphany browser keeps running my code without bugs.</p>

            <summary>
                <![CDATA[
                    <p>I've managed to find some time to spend at my computer recently, after all the festivities and flu. I decided I would continue working on the accessibility and ARIA compliance on my main website. Next on the list was the filter search that I use on my index pages.</p>

                <p>I've managed to find some time to spend at my computer recently, after all the festivities and flu. I decided I would continue working on the accessibility and ARIA compliance on my main website. Next on the list was the filter search that I use on my index pages.</p>

<p>Each article has a list of tags (which I call topics on my site), and some JavaScript code makes a list of clickable topics near the start of the page that will filter the articles that contain the selected topic.</p>
<p>The first thing I decided to do was to place the all the filter search related elements into a search element. I hadn't known this element existed until I researched ARIA. So now it's all in a semantically named landmark for assistive technologies to distinguish. Great!</p>
<p>In the dev tools in Firefox, I was getting a warning in the accessibility pane that these things that behave as buttons do not have the role of buttons. Originally it was because I had the CSS made up for my topic tags, so I just made the same topic tags to sit at the top of the page - the only difference being that these ones are clickable. Well, if something behaves like a button, why not just make it a button? I've styled my buttons in my website to look like anchors, but with descriptive text that makes it quite obvious that this thing I click does something on the page instead of taking me to a different page - it's fine, it's visually noticeable and the intent is explicitly indicated. So I had to do some CSS trickery to make these buttons look like topic tags instead. Everything looks the same as before, except now the topic buttons are now focusable, and there's a sensibly named landmark.</p>
<p>One more thing about buttons: as these are stateful buttons, I also needed to include the <code>aria-pressed</code> attribute.</p>
<p>Previously (or currently, depending on when you're reading this; I still have to make some updates to the CMS Python module to reflect these changes), I have truncated the topics list using <code>max-height</code> and a fade with <code>overflow: hidden</code>. I set a resize listener on the window to pick up on when a browser window might be tiled to the side - I was truncating the list if it exceeded X amount of the vertical screen real estate. When I gave it some thought, I realised there were 2 issues with this. The first is that although they are hidden from view, all the topics were still in the accessibility tree, so for my guides index page, a user would have to sit through 37 topics before getting to the article links. That's too many. The second was my realisation that this is what was responsible for a graphical glitch on only <em>some</em> mobile browsers - particularly the browsers that hide the address bar on scroll, and you know, resize the window? Duh. How did it take until now to realise why that was happening? (face-palm).</p>
<p>So threw away my JavaScript truncation, and replaced it with a fairly tidy piece of CSS:</p>
<pre class="language-css"><code>search#topics {
  ...

  &amp;.truncated li:nth-of-type(n+7) {
    display: none;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, when the <code>truncated</code> class is applied to the <code>ul</code> element, only the first 6 topics are rendered. Thanks to <code>display: none;</code>, this is the case for the visual document <em>and</em> the accessibility tree.</p>
<p>Next I needed some user messages, with <code>aria-describedby</code>, <code>aria-live="polite"</code>, and <code>role="status"</code> to indicate the various states of the topic list. There are two different <em>"statenesses"</em> here, if you will pardon my English.</p>
<ol>
<li>If a filter is currently applied or not</li>
<li>If the list of topics is truncated or not</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not sure that two status indicators can describe the same UI component, and I didn't want to potentially create confusion even if they could. So I bundled both messages into the same <code>p</code> element, with a <code>span</code> for each and an <code>id</code> to distinguish between each. With the user feedback messages, all the lines I had stripped from my JavaScript file were quickly refilled with new code. But for a better experience for an end user: it's arguably worth it.</p>
<p>Any structural work to my website, such as this, requires some modification and testing with the CMS module. But after that's done and changes are pushed, I shouldn't have to think about it again. There is one aspect I'm mulling over before I finalise my changes: when all filters are showing, i.e. no truncation, and a topic is selected to apply a filter that is placed <em>after</em> where the truncation would occur (so index 7 onwards), if the topic list is then truncated, then that topic is hidden and can't be deselected without reopening the full list. It's a dead end situation that can be escaped, but requires more analysis and problem solving than what is fair to place onto an end user. As I assess, I think I may be able to just apply <code>display: inline;</code> to the selected topic to override the <code>display: none;</code> that is applied to truncate it, ensuring any selected topic is not hidden from view, regardless of it's index.</p>
<p>When looking up potential methods for applying a search filter, I came across a few different options that I didn't really vibe with for this use case. But I must admit I was especially pleased that W3 schools offered the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_filter_elements.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same solution</a> as I has already came up with myself. It's nice to have some affirmation that you are making good decisions.</p>

                <p>2026 has been slow getting started for me. I was just about done with Christmas and New Year celebrations, ready to get back to life's usual flow, but then I got a damned flu.</p>

<p>I had been trying to avoid it. I work in a youth club with kids visiting from numerous local schools, and also commute to work via the busy London train network. So I am surprised I didn't get it sooner - given the state of my fellow commuters throughout December, I was sure it was going to spoil the festive period for me. But I was lucky. For a time.</p>
<p>I had been looking forward to continuing work on some of my projects, and starting some new ones. But I was floored for about a week. When I felt myself beginning to recover, I did make a start on one of my planned projects, if only to feel like I had at least <em>one</em> productive evening that week. I made I good start, and now it's back on the shelf while I wait for some things to come in the post.</p>
<p>The last 4 days I have been busy back at work - a week with flu had me more than eager to get out of the house again and doing something useful. I even gave up my usual work from home day this week in the revelry of being able to comfortably leave the house again.</p>
<p>I do tend to suffer some inertia going in to and coming out of breaks. I've been somewhat scratching my head and avoiding my desk for want of knowing what to start first. This blog has been helpful getting me to my keyboard. It's a low effort exercise that I can do to get things started. The CMS software handles everything for me, so I can just type out some <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dribble</span>/thoughts and feel like I've accomplished something.</p>

                <p>This is the second year that I've opted to stay away from my computer (in a recreational sense) throughout the lead up to Christmas. I feel better for it. As much as I enjoy working on my various projects, December can always feel like there isn't enough time to get everything done, especially around work and catching up with friends and family.</p>

<p>Last year, feeling a little overwhelmed by everything I had to do and a little crunched for time, I ended up staying away from my computer while I tackled everything that needed to be tackled. I don't remember if it was a conscious decision or not, but what I do remember was that it might have been the first Christmas I genuinely enjoyed.</p>
<p>This time around, I knowingly employed the same strategy. I still felt a little stressed as Christmas approached, and like time was running thin, but it didn't stress me out to the point that I had a bad time. Being stressed because you <em>might not</em> have enough time to get everything done, and being stressed because you <em>don't</em> have enough time to get everything done, are two very different beasts.</p>
<p>Today is the first day in a while that I've been able to ignore my phone, put the radio on, and just sit at my desk for an extended period of time without having to worry about anything else. I booked the past week off work, with the hope that might find a few hours to sit where I am now sooner, but this time of year is busy, and I'm not too upset that I've only got the chance to do this today. I'm back to work tomorrow, and I can back to my usual routine of stealing an hour or two when I can to enjoy myself with some coding or computer based projects.</p>
<p>Now I just need to look at my projects and figure out where I had got to and what on earth I was about to do before my hiatus..</p>

                    <p>I've found something in Publii to nag about, although it's not really the fault of Publii per se. It's more to do with loose specs and lack of standardisation elsewhere, and the issues this can then cause.</p>

                <p>I've found something in Publii to nag about, although it's not really the fault of Publii per se. It's more to do with loose specs and lack of standardisation elsewhere, and the issues this can then cause.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/aria-compliant-breadcrumbs/">previous post</a>, I used the primsJS plugin to include some HTML and CSS code. The plugin is marked as outdated, I haven't looked at how to update or if there even is an update available yet. That's fine though, it works as intended nonetheless (or as far as my particular user case intends). It highlights syntax, it looks pretty. The plugin is not the problem here.</p>
<p>Publii uses Atom feed specification as opposed to RSS. Why? I don't know, it doesn't really matter. RSS and Atom are just two arcane leaves on the same tree that everybody uses without even knowing the technologies exist. They have both been around long enough that any feed reader should be able to parse the data from any given feed .. <em>should.</em></p>

<figcaption >Nextcloud News has not differentiated between escaped and non escaped HTML and has render my code blocks into the DOM</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>My favourite feed reader, Nextcloud News, apparently doesn't like Atom HTML content. It may be that Publii has used HTML as the type attribute for the content element. That's the only thing I can think of that could be causing it. Atom's spec says HTML should be escaped, which would the render the escaped HTML in the prism code blocks moot. Maybe this should have been rendered as XHTML? <em>But, then again:</em> this problem doesn't seem to occur in other feed readers I've looked at.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/feedbro.jpeg" alt="" width="927" height="867" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/feedbro-xs.jpeg 640w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/feedbro-sm.jpeg 768w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/feedbro-md.jpeg 1024w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/feedbro-lg.jpeg 1366w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/feedbro-xl.jpeg 1600w ,https://blog.aaronwatts.dev/media/posts/15/responsive/feedbro-2xl.jpeg 1920w"></figure>
<figcaption >Feedbro Firefox extension has rendered the content as expected</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I could test my theory, and figure out some kind of a solution. Maybe I could set up a CI/CD solution to tweak the feed after it's made - there is no real way to change the RSS feed at this level within the Publii software. But then again, I think I just won't. The point of blogging in Publii was that it was supposed to be quick and easy. I have enough distractions and rabbit holes already, I don't need another.</p>
<p>"Works in most feed readers" is not bad to be fair. With so many revisions to specifications and differing standards for syndication feeds, I think it's surprising how good the compatibility in general already is, even if it's not perfect in some places. And including full content of an article is technically a complimentary extra to RSS feeds as it is. As for Publii's choice in syndication formats, I will respect it. I will likely just put a warning to let readers know this feed might not work in some readers whenever I include code blocks that resemble XML.</p>
<p>I will say though: I feel a certain validation in the choices I made with the RSS feed in my main website. In the corners of the syndication software world I have explored as yet, my feed seems to have a pretty high compatibility rate.</p>

                <![CDATA[
                    <p>I've been looking at improving accessibility across my main website. One of my main goals when building it originally was to keep it as simple as possible, which is now paying off as I begin to make changes. Despite keeping it simple, I did still want the site to have at least <em>some</em> character, to have a little bit of me in it. So I went with the not so unique approach of styling parts of the site to look like terminal output, such as my main site navigation. I used a breadcrumb navigation and styled it to look like a directory path in a terminal prompt.</p>

                <p>I've been looking at improving accessibility across my main website. One of my main goals when building it originally was to keep it as simple as possible, which is now paying off as I begin to make changes. Despite keeping it simple, I did still want the site to have at least <em>some</em> character, to have a little bit of me in it. So I went with the not so unique approach of styling parts of the site to look like terminal output, such as my main site navigation. I used a breadcrumb navigation and styled it to look like a directory path in a terminal prompt.</p>

<p>After some reading and research, I concluded that my breadcrumb nav had an issue. There was decorative text in there that was of no value to the user, and would likely cause issues for anyone using a screen reader or other accessible technology.</p>
<p>You might notice I am putting line breaks in odd places in my markup, this is because a line break in HTML is considered equal to one character-width of white space, and I didn't want my text flying off the right hand side of my screen (I don't wrap my code editors).</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code>&lt;header&gt;
  &lt;nav class="breadcrumbs"&gt;
    &lt;span class="host"&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;aaronwatts@dev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span
      class="path"&gt;/&lt;a href="/guides"&gt;guides&lt;/a&gt;/firefox-web-apps $&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, after browsing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARIA guidance pages</a>, I discovered that there is a recommended <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/breadcrumb/examples/breadcrumb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pattern for breadcrumb navigation</a>:</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code>&lt;nav aria-label="Breadcrumb" class="breadcrumb"&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="../../../.."&gt;
        WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="../../../"&gt;
        Patterns
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="../../"&gt;
        Breadcrumb Pattern
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="" aria-current="page"&gt;
        Breadcrumb Example
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I have also recently redesigned the hero for my site's home page to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hide decorative text from the cursor (i.e. no highlight/copy)</li>
<li>Hide decorative text from ARIA technology</li>
</ol>
<p>I achieved this by applying CSS <code>::after</code> pseudo elements to spans marked as <code>aria-hidden</code>. I may have been okay just using <code>::after</code> pseudo elements, but there was a little debate on StackOverflow as to whether or not this is definitely hidden from the accessibility tree or not.</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code>&lt;header&gt;
  &lt;div class="hero"&gt;
    &lt;span class="hero-text"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="host"&gt;aaronwatts@dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;span
        aria-hidden="true" class="term-dir" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
        aria-hidden="true" class="term-priv" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
        aria-hidden="true" class="term-cursor" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;</code></pre>
<pre class="language-css"><code>.hero span.term-cursor::after {
  content: ' █';
}

.term-priv::after {
  content: ' $';
}

.hero .term-dir::after {
  content: ':~';
}</code></pre>
<p>So, in accordance with the ARIA pattern for breadcrumbs, I have rewritten by navigation to be an ordered list, ready to be styled to look like a terminal prompt, while hiding any decorative text from the main tree. I am also still breaking my lines in weird places to preserve white space. While redesigning this, I learned that <code>href=""</code> is equivalent to <code>href="#"</code>, but differs only in the sense that the former doesn't add an entry to the history object whereas the latter does.</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code>&lt;header&gt;
  &lt;nav aria-label="Breadcrumb"&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a 
        href="/"&gt;aaronwatts@dev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span
        aria-hidden="true" class="term-dir"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a 
        href="/guides/"&gt;guides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
        href="" aria-current="page"&gt;appsheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span
        aria-hidden="true" class="term-priv"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;</code></pre>
<p>With some fancy pants CSS selectors and nesting, I got things looking the way I wanted. It's moments like this when I feel like I'm finally getting the hang of CSS, everything just kind of worked first time. I wish that were the case all the time.</p>
<pre class="language-css"><code>nav[aria-label='Breadcrumb'] {
  font-family: JetBrainsMono;
  font-size: .9rem;
  font-weight: bold;
  letter-spacing: .09rem;
  box-sizing: border-box;

  &amp; ol {
    list-style-type: none;
    padding: 0;
  }

  &amp; li {
    display: inline;
        
    &amp; a {
      text-decoration: none;
      color: var(--accent-secondary);

      &amp;:hover {
        color: var(--accent-secondary-light);
      }
    }
  }

  &amp; li:first-of-type a {
    color: var(--accent-primary);

    &amp;:hover {

    }
  }

  &amp; li:not(li:first-of-type)::before {
    content: '/'; 
    color: var(--accent-secondary);
  }

  &amp; .term-dir::after {
    content: ':';
  }
}

.path,
.term-priv {
  color: var(--accent-secondary);
}

.term-priv::after {
  content: ' $';
}</code></pre>

                <p>I've been looking for an excuse to move my main pi 5 over to the TV with the new version of Plasma Bigscreen running on it, and hopefully Steam too. So now my main workhorse is the pi 500+.</p>

<p>It's nice. A mechanical keyboard with changeable back light settings, 16GB RAM and an SSD. It's an upgrade from my pi 5 with 8GB RAM in an Argon One case. That device will be replacing my pi 4 in it's own Argon One case that I have connected to the TV and do all my streaming on. The main reason I've been wanting to get my pi 5 to the TV is how well it handles video, the pi 4 does a good enough job with work arounds for Youtube (Freetube or VaccuumTube, whichever is working at the time), but the pi 5 should be able to jump up my streaming from 720 to 1080.</p>
<p>I will be putting Raspberry Pi's Debian Trixie OS on there, so it will have the newer Plasma. But that also means that Plasma Bigscreen is not available in the apt repo anymore, so I will have to build it with the KDE developer tools, which I've never used before - hopefully that all goes well. I will put it on my <a href="https://aaronwatts.dev/guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guides Page</a> if it works out.</p>
<p>Back to the 500+. It's my main workhorse now. I've been computing exclusively on Raspberry Pi's for a while now since my installation of Endeavour OS with i3wm decided it didn't like my (admittedly ancient) graphics card. My 2012 MacBook's keyboard had just died, and while I enjoy tinkering and fixing things, I had to clock in to my remote working shift so I just logged in on my pi 4 and was not put off enough by the experience to change my set up thereafter. Shortly after that, the pi 5 released, and for what I'm doing on a computer, the pi 5 was easily powerful enough to do everything I wanted it to do.</p>
<p>The pi 500+ is just a turbo charged version of what I was already using. I'm working right now with Firefox and Chromium open, while editing on Publii, and the CPU usage is barely hitting 4%, while the GPU bounces between 5% and 10%. I'm becoming a bit of a reluctant pro at setting up Raspberry Pi's Debian. Setting up a Nextcloud and backing up my configs really paid off here. I'm not quite at the stage of having my own setup or install scripts, but if I have to do this many more times I may have to consider it. I'm trying to put my distro hopping days are behind me.</p>
<p>It is nice to have the entire computer inside the keyboard, it's a nice homage to the old days of computing, and when the tech is becoming this compact - why wouldn't you? Although this does bring additional wires across your desk. I may tie those together to tidy the up a bit. The board is nice and heavy and does not slide around at all while you work. The mechanical keys take a little getting used to if you're used to low keys like I am, but a couple hours of working has me feeling pretty comfortable with the differences already.</p>

                <p>I've put my Publii files in my cloud. That means I can now work on my blog from almost anywhere. Like right now, from my work (I'm on a break, boss!).</p>

<p>It wasn't hard to set up, the only additional step beside setting the save location was generating an additional token on Github for my site to sync. The token credentials is the only thing that doesn't seem to have copied over - a wise security choice. I'm using Nextcloud, but I don't see why any cloud with a decent sync pattern wouldn't work. So, while Publii doesn't <em>officially</em> support multiple users working on one site, I don't see why you couldn't potentially share the file directory on a cloud with a reasonable caching system.</p>
<p>However, Publii uses local SQLite to control some data, so this could potentially cause issues across multiple users if they are working on the website at the same time. I'm not entirely sure how something like Redis might manage that, but in my mind's eye, I don't really see it working out too well - especially after having to work through some conflicts in my Nextcloud due to a failed sync operation.</p>
<p>I think the best approach to cooperative content management would be to appoint an administrator to post content produced by a team to prevent conflicts. But for a sole blogger, like myself, Publii in the cloud is a fantastic way to work.</p>

<h2>Changes so far</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>home.html</code> is gone, <code>index.html</code> is the new home, no more splash page</li>
<li>Decorative text, namely the <code>~: $</code> path and privilege indicators on my home page <code>h1</code> are now <code>::after content</code> and also wrapped in <code>span</code> with <code>aria-hidden</code> set to <code>true</code></li>
<li>Anything to do with navigation is in a <code>nav</code> element, <code>main.article</code> and <code>div.article</code> have been replaced by <code>main &gt; article</code> and <code>article</code> respectively</li>
<li>Guides, which have sections and a page navigation now are split into <code>section</code></li>
<li>I've made better use of <code>header</code> wherever it seems appropriate</li>
<li>JetBrainsMono is now the monospace font across the site, this is to ensure the <code>h1</code> on the home page resizes as expected, fonts are preloaded - also yay for font ligatures!</li>
</ul>
<p>This should all help make my content more accessible. Although there is plenty more to work on.</p>
<h2>Changes to come</h2>
<ul>
<li>ARIA practises and patterns to be better implemented across the site</li>
<li>Breadcrumbs to have decorative text obscured as with home, and to follow ARIA pattern</li>
<li>In rewriting parts of my CMS to match the new structure, I've seen that could do with some housekeeping, particularly <code>None</code> catches for the tests I run prior to building</li>
<li>Schemas and OpenGraph to be implemented</li>
<li>Schemas and OpenGraph may as well be automated along with other meta that can be pulled from existing content - why write it twice?</li>
<li>Guides and Tech descriptions may as well be pulled from the home page for the RSS feeds while I'm doing the other stuff in the CMS</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, that's all for another day. I've been working on my CMS rewrite and the subsequent restructure for so long, that I haven't actually posted anything for a few months now, so I might as well write a new article or two for the time being. Thanks for being my rubber duck.</p>
